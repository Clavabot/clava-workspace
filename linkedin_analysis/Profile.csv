Alex,Voronovich,,San Francisco / Miami,"Sep 2, 1976",Founder | Fintech Product Creator | Engineer | Forbes Council Member,"I am a technology leader with 15+ years of experience spanning AI, infrastructure, banking, compliance, and payments. My work centers on building and scaling complex, high-impact systems — from cross-border platforms to AI-driven architectures — and delivering them in highly regulated, global environments.  I thrive on solving problems that sit at the intersection of technology, regulation, and scale. Over my career, I’ve led projects across the U.S., Europe, Africa, and emerging markets, working with diverse teams and cultures to deliver resilient, production-grade systems.  I bring a generalist mindset with deep execution ability — moving from architecture and integration to full launch of systems that support millions of users and multi-market operations.",Financial Services,94108,"San Francisco, California, United States",,"[COMPANY:http://mycashq.com,COMPANY:http://B-Platform.io]",
